Assignments and final project done in ML
# Code for Assignments ive completed in my ML/AI Class
Assignment 1 - A simple linear regression on a dataset generated using sklearn.datasets.make_regression, then plotting the data along with the linear regression line using both scikit-learn's LinearRegression model and the manual calculation of the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) coefficients.

Assignment 2 -  To perform a logistic regression on a dataset (file_pe.csv) while using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select the most important features.

Assignment 4 -  Comparing the performance of two classifiers: AdaBoost and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) on a dataset, and it visualizes the comparison of their accuracy and F1-scores.

Final Project -  Performing multi-model classification and evaluation using 5 different machine learning classifiers, and it evaluates them based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The dataset is taken from two CloudTrail JSON files, which are normalized and encoded for use in training the models.
